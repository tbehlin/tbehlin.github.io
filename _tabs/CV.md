### Semi-Analytic Cosmological Simulation - May 2023 to Present

###### *Faculty Mentor: Eli Visbal, Ph.D.*

Worked as a paid research assistant on improving a semi-analytic cosmological simulation of the epoch of reionization. Made a number of improvements to the existing model including implementation of recombination, non-periodic boundary conditions, and density consideration, as well as created several custom metrics for measuring success of the model output.



### Gun Violence Archive Analysis - March 2023 to Present

###### *Faculty Mentor: David Lilley, Ph.D.*

Worked alongside a faculty mentor to create a custom python web scraper to retrieve highly specific data for nearly 300,000 incident pages present on the Gun Violence Archive website. This data was then spatially merged with location information, extensively analyzed, and cross-checked with a variety of other datasets, including FBI Homicide data, Google Mobility data, and CDC Mortality data.



### Cluster Research Pod - January 2023 to Present

###### Faculty Mentor: Rupali Chandar, Ph.D.

Worked with a group of undergraduate peers and a graduate mentor to classify and age-date clusters within several peculiar galaxies, with specific focus on IC4687. Worked to create a photometric pipeline to extract cluster positions and colors from newly taken James Webb Space Telescope images. Created various python scripts to aid with reducing and collating data.



### YSOLab - September 2022 to Present

###### Faculty Mentor: Tom Megeath, Ph.D.

Worked with a group of undergraduate peers to gather, reduce, and plot light curve data for variable protostars. Was a key contributor on the primary program used to autonomously perform these actions on a group of given sources, producing light curves and individual tables containing data extracted for each source.



### Historic South Initiative Project - September 2022 to December 2022

###### Faculty Mentor: Heather Bradley

Worked alongside a small group of classmates and an organization representative to plan and execute a data collection project on possible home improvement targets for the non-profit organization Historic South Initiative. The result of this project was a sortable spreadsheet of every house in the neighborhood, a total of 740 entries, including pictures, build year, tax status, and repair information. This spreadsheet is now in use by the organization for identifying ideal project targets.



### MSOE NSF REU - May 2022 to August 2022

###### Faculty Mentor: Subha Kumpaty, Ph.D.

Worked independently to design, create, and test a realistic brain proxy for calibrating MRI machines as part of a NSF REU program. Utilized CAD modeling, 3D printing, and agar-gel doping to recreate specific properties of the human brain within irregularly-shaped media. Worked with collaborators to obtain MRI images of proxy. Documented research in a final paper, a presentation to faculty, and an abstract presented at NCUR 2023.


### FTC Robotics Team - September 2018 - May 2020

Worked both alongside and as a leader of a group of high school peers on an FTC robotics team to construct a competition robot for the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons. Was principally responsible for the CAD process that propelled our team to 5th in our division at the world championship competition in 2019.

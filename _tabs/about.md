Hey! My name is Thomas Behling. I am currently a Ph.D. student at MSU, in the Dual Ph.D. Astrophysics and Computer Science Program.

My academic interests are currently centered around astronomy, programming and statistics, more specifically applying the latter to problems in the former.

My hobbies include video games, playing the violin, table-top role playing games, and hiking.

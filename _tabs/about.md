Hey! My name is Thomas Behling. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Toledo, headed into my Senior year. I am majoring in Astrophysics, with minors in Math and Data Science.

My academic interests are currently centered around astronomy, programming and statistics, more specifically applying the latter to problems in the former.

My hobbies include video games, playing the violin, table-top role playing games, and hiking.
